# Sentiment Analysis
 
## Introduction
This project is to develop sentiment analysis models for food review using the YELP restaurant review dataset from Kaggle. There are two models: Convolutional Neural Network with Word Embedding Layer model and Long Short-Term Memory model

## How to run?
Prepare `python 3.6` or `python 3.7`

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies for this project.

Download the pre-trained word vectors from [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) or access this [link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) for further information. Put the pre-trained word vectors in the same directory with the models.

Run `python CNN.py` or `python LSTM.py` to see the results.
